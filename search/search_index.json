At Simha &amp; Sarwa Associates, our strategies are built on how a case is decided.</p> <p>Having served as Civil Judges and Magistrates, our founding partners have spent years behind the bench, analyzing thousands of arguments and rendering judgments. This transition from the judiciary to private practice provides our clients with three distinct advantages:</p> <p>1. Anticipating the Bench</p> <p>Because we have written judgments ourselves, we understand the specific nuances that influence a court's decision. We don't just prepare a case; we prepare it to meet the exact standards of scrutiny used by the presiding officer. We anticipate the questions a judge will ask before they are ever voiced.</p> <p>2. Mastery of Procedural Rigor</p> <p>In the Indian legal system, many cases are won or lost on procedural technicalities\u2014especially in Real Estate and Criminal Litigation. Our experience in the judiciary ensures that every filing, every piece of evidence, and every stage of the trial is handled with \"procedural exactitude,\" minimizing delays and maximizing technical merit.</p> <p>3. Realistic Case Assessment</p> <p>We provide our clients with an unvarnished view of their legal standing. Our judicial background allows us to strip away the noise of a dispute and focus on the \"evidentiary appreciation\" that truly matters. This leads to more efficient resolutions and strategic realism in settlement negotiations or trial preparation.</p> <p> Legal reference materials</p> <p>The information on this website is provided for general informational purposes only.</p>"},{"location":"blog.html","title":"Blog and updates","text":"<p>Updates and insights will appear here.</p> <p>The information on this website is provided for general informational purposes only.</p>"},{"location":"contact.html","title":"Contact","text":""},{"location":"contact.html#contact-information","title":"Contact Information","text":"<p>Office Address 6-3-596/33, Alpha Residency,  Venkatarama Colony Community Hall, Venkatarama Colony,  Venkata Ramana Colony-Khairatabad,  Hyderabad-500004, Telangana</p> <p>Get directions</p> <p>Telephone +91-9908445005</p> <p>Email info@simhasarwa.com</p>"},{"location":"people.html","title":"People","text":"Ankit Sarwa <p>Founding Partner</p> <p>         Ankit S. is a founding partner at Simha &amp; Sarwa Associates, bringing a rare depth of insight to the firm\u2019s litigation and advisory practices.

We view it as one of many tools used to achieve a definitive, sustainable resolution. Our philosophy is rooted in the transition from the impartiality of the bench to the strategic commitment of advocacy.</p> Clarity Over Conflict <p>Legal disputes are often clouded by procedural noise and emotional escalation. Our first priority is to provide clarity of thought. By stripping a case down to its core legal and factual merits, we help our clients see the most direct path to a conclusion, whether that is through aggressive litigation, strategic settlement, or alternative dispute resolution.</p> Intellectual Integrity <p>We believe that the most persuasive advocacy is grounded in doctrinal depth. Our work is characterized by a \"scholar-practitioner\" approach\u2014leveraging high-level academic research and a deep respect for jurisprudence to build arguments that are not only compelling but legally resilient.</p> Principled Advocacy <p>Our time in the judiciary has instilled in us an uncompromising commitment to procedural exactitude and ethical standards. We represent our clients with the same rigor and respect for the law that we expected from the advocates who appeared before us. To us, credibility is the most valuable asset a lawyer can bring to the courtroom.</p> Long-Term Guardianship <p>We do not just manage cases; we manage relationships. Our goal is to serve as long-term legal guardians for our clients, providing a composed and stable presence in the face of complex legal challenges.
