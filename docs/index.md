Welcome to the digital gateway of Simha & Sarwa Associates, a full-service law firm based in Hyderabad. Founded by former members of the judiciary, our firm is built on the belief that effective legal representation requires a deep understanding of both the letter of the law and the mechanics of judicial decision-making.

We advise clients on legal, regulatory, and procedural aspects of matters before courts, tribunals, and other authorities in India. Our practice is guided by professional standards, ethical obligations, and applicable laws.

### Our Foundation

At Simha & Sarwa Associates, we offer a rare vantage point. Our founding partners transitioned from the bench to private practice, bringing with them years of experience as Civil Judges and Magistrates. This "inside-out" perspective allows us to approach every matter with:
